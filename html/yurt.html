            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden
                floor, and
                a roof dome that can be opened.
            </p>

            <h3>How are the yurts furnished? </h3>
            <p> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping
                experience also
                includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                located in the
                lodge.
